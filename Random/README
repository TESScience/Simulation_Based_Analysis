Development of very fast pseudo-random number generators for parallel processing.

These are combinations of Fibonnaci, linear congruential and and MPWD's "safe prime"
method.

randa is a classic long-lag (24/55) additive Fibonnaci generator.
calrissian is a safe prime plus linear congruential.
sqarission is a small safe prime squared plus linear conguential.
squafib is a small safe prime squared plus minimal additive Fibonnaci.

random is a test command that writes random binary numbers to stdout.
